      - This project has potential applications in healthcare communications, patient education, and public health awareness campaigns, where simplifying complex information is crucial.

  - **Development of an Annotated Corpus for Problem-Solving Explanations:**
    - **Objective:** The primary goal of this project was to enhance the problem-solving capabilities of language models by developing an annotated corpus based on the AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) dataset. The project aimed to generate natural language explanations for solving each problem in the dataset, thereby enabling the fine-tuning of a language model that could follow a structured "Tree of Thought" prompting approach.
    - **Methodology:**
      - **Dataset Selection:** Started with the **AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC)** dataset, which contains challenging multiple-choice science questions that require reasoning and problem-solving skills beyond simple fact retrieval.
      - **Annotation Process:**
        - Developed a detailed annotation scheme that involved creating step-by-step natural language explanations for each problem in the ARC dataset.
        - These explanations were structured according to a "Tree of Thought" framework, breaking down the problem-solving process into a series of logical, sequential steps.
      - **Model Fine-Tuning:**
        - Used the annotated corpus to fine-tune a pre-trained language model, focusing on improving its ability to follow complex reasoning paths.
        - The fine-tuning process emphasized the model's understanding of the problem-solving steps, enabling it to generate coherent and logical explanations when faced with similar problems.
      - **Tree of Thought Prompting:**
        - Implemented the "Tree of Thought" prompting technique to guide the model's reasoning process, ensuring that each step in the problem-solving sequence was clearly articulated and logically consistent.
    - **Outcomes:**
      - **Enhanced Problem-Solving Ability:** The fine-tuned model demonstrated a significant improvement in its ability to solve complex problems from the ARC dataset, effectively following the structured reasoning process laid out in the annotated corpus.
      - **Improved Explanation Generation:** The model was able to generate clear, step-by-step explanations for each problem, making its reasoning process transparent and easier to understand.
      - **Potential Applications:** This approach can be applied to other domains where complex reasoning and decision-making are required, such as legal reasoning, medical diagnosis, and educational tools that teach critical thinking skills.
      - **Research Contribution:** The project contributed to the field by showing how structured annotations and prompting techniques can be used to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language models, providing a framework for future research in explainable AI.
